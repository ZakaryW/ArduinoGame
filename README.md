# ArduinoGame

# Ada fruit playground express simon says game

# Startup:
# Upon successful start, the game will play a welcome pattern colored light blue

# Rules/ how to play:
# The game will generate a sequence of random events.
# The difficulty of game is rooted in how many events you must match starting with 1, and incrementing to 7.
# The adafruit will output the pattern you must match.
# Hold the board out flat with the usb port facing away from you.
# The following outputs are matched to their inputs, single LED -> adjacent button press, half the board LEDs -> tilt the board in the direction of the LEDs downward.
# Additionally the adjacent input directions are matched by color, with red indicting an input only on the right side of the board and blue indicting an input on the left.
